## 🚀 Introduction

The **NG IM FORM powered by Bootstrap** enables developers to create dynamic and configurable forms at runtime.  
It provides a visual interface where users can add **multiple sections**, and within each section, they can insert **form fields** such as text inputs, text areas, select boxes, and radio button groups.

Each section and field can be **reordered via drag-and-drop**, offering total flexibility in form layout.  
The library is built with **Bootstrap 5** for a clean, modern, and fully responsive look.

Once the form is designed, it can be **submitted as JSON**, making it ideal for scenarios like:

- Custom form builders
- Survey generators
- Dynamic data entry systems
