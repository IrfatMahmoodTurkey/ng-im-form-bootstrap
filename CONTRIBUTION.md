# Contributing Guidelines



Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Please read the following guidelines carefully before making any contributions.



## 🚀 How to Contribute



### 1. **Fork the Repository**



Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.



### 2. **Work on the `development` Branch**



All contributions must be based on the `development` branch.



- If you are adding new features, fixing bugs, or making UI changes, always create your branch from `development`.

- **Any change submitted to the `main` branch will be rejected.**



Example:



```bash

git checkout development

git pull origin development

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

```



### 3. **Contribution Process**



Don't build the project — just code, test, and create a new PR. We will review your contribution, and your effort will be highly appreciated.



## 📝 Writing a Proper PR Description



When submitting a Pull Request, please ensure your description is clear and complete.



Your PR description **must include**:



1. **What changes were made** – Describe clearly what you added, removed, or modified.

2. **Why the changes were needed** – Mention the reason, issue, or context.

3. **Screenshots (if UI-related)** – Before/after screenshots are highly recommended.

4. **Steps to test the changes** – Help reviewers verify your contribution.
